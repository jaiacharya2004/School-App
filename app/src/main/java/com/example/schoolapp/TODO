    // School Head Signup Empty text field messages
     // Empty fields and incorrect formats

// We have to implement Logout as well and also have to deallocate the memory
// A intermediate Screen is required between activate screen and confirm password screen we can just send an email verification link in intermediate screen no need for an OTP
// for now user is activated we need a user object to be instantiated and a mainviewmodel for saving the user authstate


// MOST CRITICAL
// Debugging and performance analysis
